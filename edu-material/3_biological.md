# Biological Learning Rules

As you've learnt in the past two weeks, neural networks use error backpropagation to be trained. There are a variety of reasons backprop is highly unlikely to run in the brain. This week, we will explore the types of learning rules that *might* exist in the brain, and how they're related (and unrelated) to deep learning.

## Background

Follow along with the lecture material - and use the lack of additional viewing this week to get more comfortable with previous weeks material.
