# Neural Networks 101

## Background

Machine Learning is all about building programs that learn from data. Neural networks are perhaps the most powerful machine learning models out there. They were only popularized since around 2013, which is incredibly fresh when you compare it to century-old theory in math/physics. The recency is because of the perfect timing of a few things:

* The ridic amount of data available now. Across the internet, mobile devices, and social media.
* The ridic amount of computational power (especially in GPUs)
* The fact that neural networks are highly parallelizable algorithms, and the fact that GPUs are very good at highly parallelizable workloads. 

This first week is a good opportunity for you to catch up on some foundational skills. 

## Make sure you know your options for a coding/development environment
* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a nice, quickstart environment for you to start coding in a `notebook' environment.
* These notebooks are wonderful for education, but in practice, large-scale projects will use a dedicated development environment.
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a popular one. [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/6i3e-j3wSf0?si=tr3qwXEtdr-hiTwM)
* Learn how to create virtual environments in VSCode, and use them.

## Get used to GitHub
* [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE)
* There are only a few commands you'll commonly use (e.g., push, pull, clone, add). P chill.

## Get used to Python
I mean, sure, ChatGPT/Claude Code is good at Python too. 
I encourage you all to try and learn without ChatGPT first, and then use it if you're really stuck - but make sure you understand the fix.

* Choose your library of choice. PyTorch is far more popular in research. Tensorflow is *slightly* more popular in production environments. I'd recommend PyTorch.

Note there are many different techniques in machine learning. We tend to focus on neural networks in our course, but if you want to become a pro, it's important to understand classical techniques too. My personal favourite course on classical machine learning comes from Kilian Weinberger: [YouTube lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl8OlHZGYOQ7bkVbuRthEsaLr7bONzbXS).
Note that Andrew Ng's Deep Learning playlists above were made quite a while ago. Some minor things are outdated. But it is still very useful to know the trajectory of the field in the past decade.
