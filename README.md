## Course Overview

To ensure all students are on the right path, we have structured the course into different tracks based on experience and goals:

* **Educational Track:** This is the starting point for all new students. In this track, you will build a foundational understanding of deep learning and its core principles through a structured curriculum. The goal is to equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary to potentially transition into a research group in the future.
* **Research Track:** This track is for returning students who are already part of a research group or have been invited to join one. Students in this track will focus on their specific research projects with their assigned mentor.

## Your Path in CMPM 118

Your next step depends on your current status. Please click on the link that applies to you:

**I am a new student, and this is my first quarter in CMPM 118**

You will begin in the Educational Track. This path is designed to give you a solid foundation in deep learning.

* **[Syllabus](https://github.com/jeshraghian/CMPM118-NCG/blob/main/syllabi/education.md)**
* **Next Steps:** Please keep an eye out on Canvas for all communication.

**I am a returning student joining/already in a research group**

If you are a returning student looking to transition into a research group, you will be contacted with a permission code and group allocations. Your research interests and strengths will be taken into account when allocating you to a group project. We encourage creativity and the development of your own original research proposals.

* **[Syllabus](https://github.com/jeshraghian/CMPM118-NCG/blob/main/syllabi/research.md)**
* The syllabus contains links to self-guided educational material you are expected to work through.
* **Next Steps:** Your tutor will reach out directly to organize weekly meetings.

Key Reminders
* Research group placement is competitive and is not guaranteed. All new students must participate in the Educational Track.

We are excited to have you in the class and look forward to a productive quarter!
