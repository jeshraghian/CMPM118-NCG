## Course Overview

To ensure all students are on the right path, we have structured the course into different tracks based on experience and goals:

* **Educational Track:** This is the starting point for all new students. In this track, you will build a foundational understanding of deep learning and its core principles through a structured curriculum. The goal is to equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary to potentially transition into a research group in the future.
* **Research Track:** This track is for returning students who are already part of a research group or have been invited to join one. Students in this track will focus on their specific research projects with their assigned mentor.

* **Next Steps:** Please keep an eye out on Canvas for all communication.

**I am a returning student joining/already in a research group**

If you are a returning student looking to transition into a research group, you will need to complete the application process within the [CMPM 118 Student Information Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSecCLmML6xFM2hLMfF01Aa9y10y9EyMK1S0YU2LiCsH6rOFtA/viewform?usp=header).

* **[Syllabus](https://github.com/SkyeGunasekaran/CMPM118-NCG/blob/main/syllabi/research.md)**
* The syllabus contains links to self-guided educational material you are expected to work through.
* **Next Steps:** Please complete the [CMPM 118 Student Information Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSecCLmML6xFM2hLMfF01Aa9y10y9EyMK1S0YU2LiCsH6rOFtA/viewform?usp=header) and indicate your interest in a research group. Your responses will be reviewed by research mentors.

Key Reminders
* All students interested in joining either the research or education group must complete the [CMPM 118 Student Information Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSecCLmML6xFM2hLMfF01Aa9y10y9EyMK1S0YU2LiCsH6rOFtA/viewform?usp=header).
* Research group placement is competitive and is not guaranteed. All new students must participate in the Educational Track.
* New students must upload their CV as part of the student information form.

We are excited to have you in the class and look forward to a productive quarter!
