# CMPM 118 / Neuromorphic Computing Group / Research Group Syllabus
Syllabus for the research portion of CMPM 118 w/ Prof. Jason Eshraghian

## Course Description 
This course serves as a structured pathway for undergraduate researchers in the Neuromorphic Computing Group. Students will participate in group projects spanning several quarters, with the aim of publishing novel research in an undergraduate-focused conference or journal (e.g., Baylearn, ICLR Tiny Papers). Select groups may also choose to pursue non-research projects, such as making significant open-source code contributions, authoring a comprehensive literature review, or tackling a competitive challenge (e.g., Kaggle).

**Note: You must only enroll as P/NP**.

**Instructor:** Select tutors

**Location & Time:** TBD

## Course Outcomes 

* Conduct novel research in AI and Neuromorphic Computing with the goal of conference or journal publication.
* Build a strong foundation for an advanced research career in academia or industry.
* Contribute to the broader undergraduate research community at UCSC and beyond.

## Suggested Prerequisites 

* CSE 30
* MATH 21
* MATH 23A
* STAT 131 
* or equivalent courses

## Grading

* **Attendance (50%):** On-time attendance at all meetings. All absences should be communicated in advance to your tutor.
* **Midterm Presentation (10%):** Occurring in Week 5, these will be recorded or in-person slide deck presentations on your research in progress.
* **Final Presentation (10%):** Occurring in Week 10, this will summarize your work.
* **Final Project (20%):** The final deliverable will be an in-progress or completed novel research project on a selected topic in Deep Learning and Neuromorphic Computing.
* **Peer Evaluation (10%):** Must be completed to receive 10%. A lack of useful contributions will scale your overall grade down.

## Schedule 
| Week(s) | Focus | Deliverables | 
| ---- | ----- | ------------ |
| 1-2 | Project Scoping & Deep Literature Review | Defined problem statement and annotated bibliography |
| 3-4 | Active Research & Experimentation | Weeekly reports on experiments and results |
| 5 | Midterm Presentation | Presentation on background, proposed methods, and initial steps |

## Diversity and Inclusion

All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment for every other member of the class.

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

UC Santa Cruz is committed to creating an academic environment that supports its diverse student body. If you are a student with a disability who requires accommodations to achieve equal access in this course, please affiliate with the DRC. I encourage all students to benefit from learning more about DRC services to contact DRC by phone at 831-459-2089 or by email at drc@ucsc.edu. For students already affiliated, make sure that you have requested Academic Access Letters, where you intend to use accommodations. You can also request to meet privately with me by appointment, as soon as possible. I would like us to discuss how we can implement your accommodations in this course to ensure your access and full engagement in this course.

## Support for Students with Other Difficulties

While we sincerely hope that you will be able to pursue your studies peacefully and worry-free, we are aware that in some cases difficulties happen that are beyond your control. You should always feel free and comfortable to bring up any problem with the instructor, but if this is not sufficient, or if you prefer professional help, here are several campus resources that you may want to consider contacting:

* **UC Care** which is a confidential space to discuss issues of dating violence, sexual assault and stalking.
* **Slug Support** where you can ask for help on many practical issues, including dealing with a financial crisis, problems with your living situation, computers, books, etc.
* **CAPS**, which provides counseling and psychological services to students.

## Academic Integrity
All members of the UCSC community have a responsibility to foster an environment of trust, honesty, fairness, respect, and responsibility. All members of the university community are expected to present as their original work only that which is truly their own. Plagiarism of any kind is unacceptable. Violations of the Academic Integrity policy can result in dismissal from the university and a permanent notation on a student’s transcript. For the full policy and disciplinary procedures on academic dishonesty, refer to the Academic Integrity page

## AI Use Policy
We encourage using Large Language Models (LLMs) as a study aid to explore and understand the course material. For the final project, you may use AI tools for brainstorming, outlining, and checking grammar. However, the core analysis, writing, and conclusions must be your own. The use of AI to generate solutions for homework problems or to write substantive portions of your final project is strictly prohibited and will be treated as an academic integrity violation.
